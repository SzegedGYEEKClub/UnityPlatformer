# UnityPlatformer
Basic Unity project for a side-scrolling platformer game.

It includes an animated character that can jump on platforms and collect coins. A simple enemy is roaming on a platform and kills the character if it touches it.

It made by Denisz Kaslik and Mark Marcikic on our free Unity pre-hack workshops for our Game Developer Hackathon.

This project will be used as a starting point at our Game Developer Hackathon in December 2016.
