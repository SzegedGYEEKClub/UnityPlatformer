# UnityPlatformer
Basic Unity project for a side-scrolling platformer game.

It includes a character without animation, which can move and jump along the scene. 
There is a platform and a background that have polling implemented as the character moves forward. 
And the camera will follow the character.

It made by Denisz Kaslik on our free Unity Basics workshop as a pre-hack event of our Game Developer Hackathon.

Feel free to ask questions or send pull requests. 
This project will be used as a starting point at our Game Developer Hackathon in December 2016.
